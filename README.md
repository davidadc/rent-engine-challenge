# Rent Engine Technical Test

This project is a technical test for applying to Rent Engine. It's a web application built using React and MUI, with a focus on demonstrating proficiency in these technologies.

The application uses Material UI for its user interface components. The tabs, tables, and other components are all from Material UI.

For data visualization, MUI Charts is used. This library provides a set of React components for creating charts, and it's used in this project to display various pie charts in the "Charts" tab.

The project uses pnpm as its package manager. pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient package manager that works with npm registries. It provides benefits like fast installs and ensures that packages are not duplicated across projects.
